**Love to hear you're interested in contributing to Snappy!**

Here are a couple of guidelines to make the process as painless as possible and the life easier for everyone involved.

---

### Prefer pull requests

If you know exactly how to implement the feature being suggested or fix the bug being reported, please open a pull request instead of an issue. Pull requests are easier than patches or inline code blocks for discussing and merging the changes.

Also, as specified by the [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model), all pull requests must originate from and target the `develop` branch, instead of `master`.

### Do some research

Be sure to check our documentation, [wiki](http://github.com/akashivskyy/snappy/wiki) and [past issues](http://github.com/akashivskyy/snappy/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) before opening any new issues.

### Be descriptive

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.

### Ask if necessary

If you do not understand the way something works or have some usage questions, feel free to ask. However, be prepared that answer can come later than expected. General questions are of lower priority than real issues.

### Follow conventions

All code contributions should match the coding convention used throughout the project. The styleguide is comming soon.
